## Brief
The objective of this project is to create an application that generates “Objects” upon a set of predefined rules.

### Additional Requirements
In addition to what has been set out in the brief, I am also required to use the following techologies:
* Kanban Board: Asana or an equivalent Kanban Board
* Version Control: Git
* CI Server: Azure Pipelines
* Configuration Management: Ansible
* Cloud Platform: Azure
* Infrastructure as Code: Terraform

### My Approach
To achieve this, I have decided to produce a Magic 8-Ball game app. In this game, a sphere that looks like an eight-ball is used for fortune-telling or seeking advice. 
The user must be able to input "yes/no" question, and then submit it or click on the ball to reveal an answer.
Additionally, I would like to allow the user to refer to a database to view all answers given by the ball.

### Database Structure

### CI Pipeline

## Project Tracking

## Risk Assessment

## Front-End Design

## Testing
The xUnit tool was used for writing unit tests for the controller of each service. The tests check whether the objects generated by services are non-null and have the correct type, and throw an exception if they are null or an incorrect type.
For the frontend service the repostiory pattern 
The Coverlet code coverage framework for C# was used for generating code coverage info during build. Screenshots of the HTML coverage report created using the ReportGenerator commandline tool can be seen below.

## Known Issues
There are no known issues.

## Future Improvements
There are a number of improvements I would like to implement in the future:
* Pull objects from a database, rather than having them in a list
* Add testing for the Home page View
* Add a button on the Home page that allows for the database content to be downloaded as a .csv file
