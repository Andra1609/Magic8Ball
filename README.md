## Brief
The objective of this project is to create an application that generates “Objects” upon a set of predefined rules.

### Additional Requirements
In addition to what has been set out in the brief, I am also required to use the following techologies:
* Kanban Board: Asana or an equivalent Kanban Board
* Version Control: Git
* CI Server: Azure Pipelines
* Configuration Management: Ansible
* Cloud Platform: Azure
* Infrastructure as Code: Terraform

### My Approach
To achieve this, I have decided to produce a Magic 8-Ball game app. In this game, a sphere that looks like an eight-ball is used for fortune-telling or seeking advice. 
The user must be able to input "yes/no" question, and then submit it or click on the ball to reveal an answer.
Additionally, I would like to allow the user to refer to a database to view all answers given by the ball/
